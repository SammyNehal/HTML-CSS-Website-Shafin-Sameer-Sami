# HTML-CSS-Website-Shafin-Sameer-Sami
# This is our submission for the HTML CSS Website Assignment for ICS4U1
## We went for a space theme and had originally planned for a booking system but that would be involve using PHP and backend so we couldn't implement that.
We have a resources doc but I'm not sure if Shafin submitted that, so I'll add a join link here (note, we did not implement everything within that doc, they were just ideas we were thinking about.): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FC-eDly6B4mMhqCctP6pfrIghI5K_gMKfylOVl2GdIQ/edit?usp=sharing
